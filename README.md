Collection of algorithmic trading, helper files for TradingView

## How to use
First, read the README file of every Indicator and Strategy to get an idea on how it works and what to expect from it.
 
Then you can just copy the code of the *.pine* and paste it in the Pine Editor of your TradingView account. 

To import indicators or strategies from SynergOps AlgoTrading into TradingView, you can follow these general steps:

1. Obtain the Indicator/Strategy Code: Find the indicator or strategy code you want to import.
2. Open TradingView: Log in to your TradingView account and navigate to the Charting platform.
3. Open the Pine Editor: Click on the "Pine Editor" tab located at the bottom of the TradingView interface. This will open the Pine Editor, where you can write and edit Pine Script code.
4. Create a New Script: In the Pine Editor, click on the "+" icon to create a new script.
5. Copy and Paste the Code: Copy the indicator or strategy code you obtained earlier and paste it into the Pine Editor window.
6. Save the Script: Give your script a name and click the "Save" button to save it. TradingView will automatically compile the script and provide you with any error messages if there are any issues with the code.
7. Apply the Indicator/Strategy: Once the script is saved and compiled without errors, you can apply it to your chart by clicking on the "Indicators" button in the top toolbar, searching for your script's name, and adding it to your chart.
